While the provision of a single EV charger to support one or two vehicles may not be an issue, connecting multiple commercial vehicles will normally require an assessment of the electricity network. You should therefore contact your DNO to discuss whether an increase in your Authorised Capacity can be accommodated on the existing network or if the supporting electrical infrastructure needs upgrading to meet your requirements.\n",

Reduction in your overall demand by achieving energy efficiencies and the introduction of demand side management technologies could also minimise, or in certain cases avoid, the need for reinforcement of the electricity network.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example, improving the energy efficiency of your depot/office buildings by reducing the amount of power used in heating, lighting, and other processes can help deliver additional capacity. Modifying how much and when you consume power on your site is also important in freeing up capacity at certain times for EV charging. This is particularly relevant where overnight charging is a requirement.\n",

      "Calculating your Fleet Charging Requirements\n",
      "\n",
      "To calculate your EV charging requirements you will need to consider the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "The distance the individual vehicles needs to cover each day and over what timescale.\n",
      "\n",
      "When will your fleet need to be charged? - (throughout the day, overnight, when vehicles return, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Where will your fleet charge? - (at home, en-route, at a destination or in depot)\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of vehicles that you will need to charge at any one time, both now and in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "What duration does your fleet need to be charged? - (e.g. 40 mins, 2-4 hours, throughout the day or overnight)\n",
      "\n",
      "The likely charging patterns - (e.g. from 80% state of charge to 100% or do you expect your fleet to be recharging from almost 0% on every occasion?).\n",
      "\n",
      "EV charger models have varying capabilities and power. If you want shorter charging times you will need higher powered chargers, which typically cost more and will increase your power requirements. A charge point installer should be able to assist you in identifying the appropriate EV charger specification, the number of charge points and power rating to meet your operational needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have Sufficient Capacity?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you know how much demand you are using, when this is occurring and the spare capacity you have available, you can determine whether your maximum peak demand, including the EV charging requirements, is likely to be below your existing Authorised Capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your maximum demand is within your Authorised Capacity and total EV demand is less than 30% of your total site demand, then it may simply be a case of notifying your DNO of your plans, which you can ask your charge point installer to do on your behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your EV charging requirements take you above your Authorised Capacity or your total EV demand is more than 30% of your total site demand, then you will either need to take steps to reduce your maximum demand, as highlighted previously, or ask your DNO to provide more power to the site before your charge point installer undertakes the installation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Load Management\n",
      "\n",
      "Load management systems offer a solution for multiple charge points to be operated without exceeding the maximum power capacity of a site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Load management can be achieved through dynamic power management to charge points, reducing the speed of charge as necessary to moderate total electrical demand, striking a balance between the number and the speed of charge points.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can allow you to install a larger number of charge points that will simply charge at a slower rate if they are all in use at the same time. The advantage of this approach is that you may not have to spend as much upgrading your grid connection yet can still install several chargers. You will need specific control systems for this, so we'd encourage you to speak to your charge point provider about this option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart Charging\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart charging refers to different intelligent functionalities that help you recharge your vehicles in an efficient and flexible way in response to an external signal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart charging includes load management but goes beyond that, allowing you to manage your EV charging in a more sophisticated manner. For instance, smart chargers enable you to automatically charge when power is cheapest, or to operate your individual charge points at different rates depending on when you need each vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with load management, coordinating your charging can enable you to install several chargers whilst not increasing your required capacity or by simply utilising the capacity you are not using at a particular time.\n",

      "\n",
      "On-site Generation and Energy Storage\n",
      "\n",
      "On-site generation and energy storage - combined with smart charging - can also enable you to reduce the size of your grid connection by levelling out your power demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means in addition to your charge points, you would also install a stationary battery that would charge up gradually over the course of the day, or whenever you're not using a large volume of energy. You can then use that stored electricity to help charge your EV fleet and reduce, or even remove, the power needed from the grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you also have solar PV installed, your solar panels will generate electricity during the day to charge up your batteries. Where that energy is not needed, you can store it for use later or sell it to your supplier and be rewarded for helping to maintain security of the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Timed Profile Connections\n",
      "\n",
      "A timed profile connection agreement with your DNO allows you to vary the amount of power that you can use based on the time of the day, subject to a pre-agreed schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, for instance, your maximum power requirements are out with peak times due to you charging your EVs overnight, this can be an effective solution as it allows you to agree different load capacities based on your usage patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example, you may wish to use up to 2.5MW of power overnight and then reduce this to 0.5MW during the daytime to meet your operational needs. This approach avoids having to upgrade the electricity network to provide the 2.5MW of capacity 24 hours a day - the cost of which could be substantial and may take some time to implement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using a Different Part of the Electricity Network\n",
      "\n",
      "Where you have a large site and have some flexibility over where to install charge points it is worth exploring whether you have access to another part of the network.\n",
