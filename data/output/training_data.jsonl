Total charger load = 20 × 22kW = 440kW, which fits within the 600kW headroom, but only if all chargers run simultaneously. 3. To further mitigate risk, apply the 30% rule: limit simultaneous charging to 30% of chargers during peak (20 × 0.30 = 6 chargers). 4. Schedule the remaining 14 chargers to charge during off‑peak (e.g., 22:00‑06:00). 5. Use a central management platform to enforce charger‑group schedules and monitor real‑time demand. 6.

Conduct a demand‑side audit to identify energy‑efficiency savings; target a 10‑15% reduction in current Maximum Demand (e.g., from 1,200kW to ~1,020kW). 2. Install smart load‑management hardware that can prioritize EV charging and shed non‑critical loads during peak periods. 3. Negotiate with the DNO for a provisional capacity increase (e.g., request 1,800kW with a “future‑fit” clause) – this often reduces later upgrade costs by up to 30%. 4. Phase charger rollout: start with 30% of total planned chargers, monitor actual demand for 12‑18 months, then scale up. 5. Budget for a potential upgrade: estimate £180‑£220/kW; for a 300kW increase, reserve £60,000‑£66,000. 6.

Apply 30% rule: only 30% of charger load may be active during peak = 0.30 × 200kW = 60kW. 3. Remaining 140kW of charger capacity must be scheduled for off‑peak (e.g., 22:00‑06:00). 4. Peak‑hour net demand = 950kW + 60kW = 1,010kW, which exceeds the 1,000kW limit by 10kW. 5. Mitigation: either (a) shift an additional 10kW of non‑critical load to off‑peak, or (b) reduce simultaneous peak chargers to 3 (150kW total, 30% = 45kW) giving peak demand 995kW. 6.

Available headroom = 500kW - 480kW = 20kW. 4. Charger load = 22kW, slightly above headroom. 5. Since the excess is only 2kW, consider: • Using a 7.4kW charger instead, or • Scheduling the 22kW charger to operate only when other loads are low (e.g., after 20:00). 6. If the business can accept timed charging, no network upgrade is needed; otherwise, request a modest capacity increase (typically 5‑10kW) from the DNO, which can be approved within 4‑6 weeks and cost roughly £1,000‑£2,000.", "metadata": {"source": "SPEN_EV_Fleet_Guide.pdf", "page": 5}}

Decision guidance: • Choose 7.4kW chargers for continuous overnight charging (longer charge time but fits capacity). • If faster turnaround is needed, adopt a mixed approach: e.g., 5 fast chargers (110kW) + 10 slow chargers (74kW) = 184kW, then apply 30% peak‑hour rule (55kW peak) leaving headroom of 45kW; schedule the fast chargers to staggered times. 6.

The EV load is 140 kW / (400 kW + 140 kW) ≈ 26 % of the new total demand, which is below the 30 % threshold.

Compare this to the Authorised Capacity (e.g., 3,000 kW). If 2,880 kW < 3,000 kW you are within capacity but exceed the 30 % guideline, so you should implement load‑management (e.g., staggered start times) to bring the EV share ≤30 % or seek DNO approval for a capacity increase.", "metadata": {"source": "SPEN_EV_Fleet_Guide.pdf", "page": 6}}

To deliver 48 kWh in 0.667 h (40 min) requires ≈72 kW of power. This means moving from a typical 22 kW charger to a 75 kW DC fast charger. Capital cost for a 75 kW unit is roughly £8,000‑£12,000 plus installation (£2,000‑£4,000).

{"input": "A company is considering depot‑based charging versus home‑charging for its sales team. How does the location affect capacity assessment?", "output": "Depot charging aggregates all loads at a single point, making it easier to calculate peak demand against the site’s authorised capacity.
